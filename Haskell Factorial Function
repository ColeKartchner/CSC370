-- Recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1                      -- Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)  -- Recursive case: n * factorial of (n - 1)

-- Main function to read input and calculate factorial
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Enter a number:"        -- Prompt user for input
    input <- getLine                 -- Read user input as a string
    let number = read input :: Integer -- Convert input to an Integer
    print (factorial number)         -- Calculate and print the factorial
